I'm back for more, this time writing a blog post after being away from this webpages for almost an entire year.
Planning to have a regular uploading scheduling, but I will not make any promisse, as life often comes fast at you and puts priorities in check.

Anywho: are blog posts supposed to be written once and only rarely updated
