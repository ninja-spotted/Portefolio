# About

- 👋 Hi, I’m @ninja-spotted
- 👀 I’m interested in Anime, Manga, Pixelart, Videogames, Embedded Systems, and Electronics!

## TODO

- [ ] Add a blog folder (and create a template)
- [ ] Create the different interest folders/pages
- [ ] Integrate gifs as buttons
- [X] Try to create pages without the use of a theme
- [X] ~~Visitor counter~~ (only using 3º party stuff 🙁)
- [ ] Beautify the written pages (might take a while lol, maybe divide task into smaller chunks)

[Trying to add more pages to the site](https://docs.github.com/pt/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-content-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll#adding-a-new-page-to-your-site)
